## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 

  My suggestion would be to make their product more attractive to consumers. For example the prepaid VISA card when an account opened. The customer is forced to use the amount before they can close. This is not a good practice from a customer point of view.  Other issue is the trading commission. There are two trading amount, 1% for trading cryptos and 2% for trading dollar to cryptos and vice versa. There are other companies in the market that have much lesser fee than this and one fee for all type of transaction. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  This will attract more customers to this platform. This will increase the volume thus, increasing revenue.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  These enhancements do not need any additional technologies.  This is marketing strategies and service features. 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
